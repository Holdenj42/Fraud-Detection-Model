# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced banking data. Using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, the model leverages a decision tree classifier to identify potential fraud with a focus using Predective A.I.

### Key Highlights:
- **Dataset**: 284,807 transactions with anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`), `Time`, and `Amount`.
- **Techniques**: 
  - Utilized a Decision Tree Classifier with a maximum depth constraint to prevent overfitting.
  - Evaluated performance using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy metrics
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Feature importance ranking.
  - Decision tree structure to understand how the model makes predictions.
- **Results**:
- Achieved a balanced accuracy score, effectively detecting fraudulent transactions.
- Demonstrated clear and interpretable decision paths for fraud detection.
  
This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning to tackle real-world financial challenges, providing actionable insights through visualizations and metrics.
