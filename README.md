# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced banking data. Using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, the model leverages a Random Forest classifier to identify potential fraud with a focus on maximizing recall and interpretability.

### Key Highlights:
- **Dataset**: 284,807 transactions with anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`), `Time`, and `Amount`.
- **Techniques**: 
  - Addressed class imbalance with weighted Random Forest.
  - Evaluated performance using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Feature importance ranking.
  - Class distribution and model performance (confusion matrix and AUC-ROC curve).
- **Results**: Achieved a high AUC-ROC score of `0.98` with robust fraud detection.

This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning to tackle real-world financial challenges, providing actionable insights through visualizations and metrics.
